			<h2>The crusty utility industry has forever...</h2>

			<p>operated under a veil of confusion, preferring to keep customers at an arms reach that&#8217;s more like the distance from Antarctica to Amsterdam. Powershop started because it was clear there had to be a better way. </p>

			<p>Our software allows us to deliver an experience that&#8217;s fast, fun, simple and cost-effective. It&#8217;s a radical new way for people to buy and control their electricity. And let&#8217;s face it, a much better one. </p>

			<h3>To make an intangible thing like electricity more visible to customers..</h3>

			<p>and help them know exactly how much they&#8217;re using, we sell it as a product in a shop. Customers can buy it in bundles of units, grab a special, or let Powershop buy it for them.  They can get up-to-date information about their power usage and cost online, or from the emails we send. By breaking down consumption into a simple language of units, we&#8217;ve made it easy for people to control the amount of power they use, and given them a vocabulary to compare how they stack up against friends.</p>

		<h3>It hasn&#8217;t been a long road, but we&#8217;ve come a long way.</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="grid-9 columns">
				<p>Powershop launched in 2009 with a staff of three and in two years had became New Zealand&#8217;s fastest ever growing business*. We began with the notion that power could be sold like any other fast-moving consumer good, in different amounts with choice to match people&#8217;s various needs and preferences. We focused on the experience to make shopping for electricity easy and enjoyable, and provided the tools people need to understand how much power they use, giving them the control to lower bills.</p>

				<p>The ride hasn&#8217;t been without its wobbles. When we started, the first few months were slow. We expected people sign up in droves, begging to be released from the shackles of their existing retailer. In reality, we found traditional retailers had done a superb job of boring their customers into an apathetic, unengaged coma.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, people talk. Our customers didn&#8217;t just tell their friends about Powershop, they raved to them. Powershop might be the newest kind of retailer but we&#8217;ve grown by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. Word has even spread to Australia, where we launched in April 2012.</p>

									<p>Ari is the New Zealand electricity industry&#8217;s resident punk CEO. He might dress like a washed-up DJ, but he has spearheaded the radical transformation of electricity retailing in New Zealand. It&#8217;s no surprise, an engineer by training, Ari spent 20 years becoming a veteran square peg in power industry round holes until he had the long-overdue light bulb moment that lead to Powershop. He started cooking up Powershop in 2006, and three years later brought it to market. By 2011, he&#8217;d grown his idea into New Zealand&#8217;s fastest-ever growing company. He occasionally enjoys raising a finger to industry goliaths, but only when they&#8217;re being greedy or stupid. Luckily he&#8217;s more courteous to customers and regularly responds personally to their questions via social media. Just don&#8217;t tweet him while he&#8217;s watching his favourite TV show.</p>

This means he&#8217;s responsible for maintaining our record-breaking customer service rankings and the smooth running of our website. As well as being very good at multi-tasking and maintaining high standards, Jim&#8217;s big brain has lead the development of Powershop&#8217;s crowning glory, a web application that exceeds all regulatory and technical requirements while remaining easy and enjoyable to use.</p>

As Powershop&#8217;s General Counsel, Monique&#8217;s accountabilities are wide-ranging and include Legal, Regulatory, Governance, HR and Stakeholder Relations.

When the rest of the power industry was churning out the same old irrelevant products, Hamish used his powers of visualisation to develop products, specials and power packs based firmly on customer needs, a first among electricity retailers. He has identified and prioritised key opportunities, built capability to achieve them, and attracted new customer segments - helping Powershop lift its commercial performance to award-winning levels.</p>

He wears it to make sure every penny spent at Powershop will not adversely impact the fair prices Powershop customers pay for their power.

Before Powershop, he spent 25 years working closely with organisations like Greenpeace International, The Economist, Universal Music and 42 Below vodka. Simon is also a founder of New Zealand's only Fair-trade banana brand, All Good Organics, and has been known to wear a bright yellow gorilla suit all in the name of brand awareness.
