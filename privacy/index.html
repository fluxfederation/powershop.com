		<h2>Privacy Act 1993 ("the Act")</h2>

		<p>If we hold personal information about you, we comply with the Act. This Privacy Policy sets out information about how we do that. Further information about privacy and your rights under the Act can be found at <a href="http://www.privacy.org.nz">www.privacy.org.nz</a>.</p>

		<p>In this privacy policy, when we refer to our website, we mean www.powershop.com.  In this privacy policy, a reference to “we”, “us” or “our” means “Powershop New Zealand Limited” or “Powershop New Zealand Limited’s”, as appropriate.</p>

		<p>Our online shop for this website is hosted by a company called Smallfish Limited (“Smallfish”). Smallfish has its own privacy policy available at: <a href="http://www.smallfish.co.nz/home/smallfish-privacy-policy">www.smallfish.co.nz/home/smallfish-privacy-policy</a>. Our privacy policy is separate and in addition to Smallfish’s privacy policy. We aren’t responsible for Smallfish’s acts or omissions in relation to your data, so we recommend you also become familiar with Smallfish’s privacy policy. See also the section below headed ‘Information collected by Smallfish’.</p>

		<p>While you use our website, including by requesting or purchasing products through our website, or when you communicate with us, we may collect and hold personal information about you. Powershop may collect information directly from our website or when we communicate with each other.</p>

		<p>If you decide to try to sign up to purchase a product, and you enter your contact details but you do not successfully complete the ordering process, we may contact you to see if we can help you finish your order and/ or to get your feedback. If we do this, we will use the personal details you have entered on the website to contact you.</p>

		<p>We use this information to analyse trends, better configure our service and messages, administer and track the performance of referring websites, our website and to understand your interactions with our website.</p>

		<p>When Google Analytics receives personal information, that information is transferred, processed and stored on Google servers around the world in accordance with Google’s privacy policy available at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">www.google.com/privacy.html</a>.</p>

		<h2>Information collected by Smallfish</h2>
		<p>Smallfish uses cookies and Google Services (including Google Analytics) to help Smallfish analyse how users use its website. Smallfish’s privacy policy refers to us as the “shop owner”, and you as our “customer”.

		<p>From time to time, Smallfish may provide Powershop with (or Powershop may request) information in an aggregated form in which the customers cannot be identified. This helps us with analysis such as trends, sales patterns and your interaction with the shop.</p>
