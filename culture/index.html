				<p>We want people who are passionate about what they do and who they do it for. Who believe that they can make a difference as an individual. People with the chutzpah to believe that they can radically transform the electricity industry by making customers love their power company. Powershop&#8217;s employees are a bunch of mavericks and free-thinkers who like to question the accepted norms of our industry in search of a better way. It makes for a dynamic workplace - it&#8217;s fast paced, fun, results-focused and rewarding.</p>

				<p>Sure we've got the pool table, fancy coffee machine, beanbags and craft beer, and our CEO wears t-shirts (and pants, most days). But underneath the smart casual exterior we're a driven lot with some of Australasia’s brightest minds in technology, business and design. Our New Zealand HQ is in Wellington, our country’s equivalent of Silicon Valley, except that it’s way smaller and has cheaper rent.</p>

				<p>Our award winning call centre is based in Masterton, a friendly country town just over the hill.  Powershop Australia is based in Melbourne, where like Wellington it has access to a highly creative talent pool and really good coffee.</p>

						<p>We&#8217;re looking for a stand-out graduate software engineer to join our Ruby on Rails development team. You&#8217;ll be smart, creative with good grades and a strong desire to join a lively - and sometimes lovely - team. You&#8217;ll have a passion for software and be keen to learn from the best.</p>

				<h3>Software Developer</h3>

					<div class="grid-6">
						<p>Powershop might look like an electricity retailer, but it’s really a tech company in disguise: its entire operations are run by our in-house software. We’re looking for more passionate developers to join us, working on our codebase alongside our incredibly good team of devs.</p>
						<p>We use Ruby on Rails. Don’t know it yet? We’ll happily train you in Rails as part of your job. Ruby is a beautiful language; we guarantee you’ll love working with it.</p>
						<p>Here’s why you want to work here:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We’ve got a relaxed environment with music, pool table, table tennis, decent coffee, beer and fruit.</li>
							<li>We’re serious about agile; it’s not a buzzword. We do scrum, small integrated dev/design/test teams, peer code reviews and unit/integration tests because they all make for better software.</li>
							<li>Use whatever platform you like. Whatever editor you want. Do TDD? Great. Hate it? Fine. Peer programming? If you like. Work how you like working.</li>
							<li>The people here are seriously smart and open to new ideas. We don’t have any dead wood.</li>
							<li>It’s a stable job in a growing company that refuses to be enterprisey.</li>
							<li>There’s something for devs of all skill levels to sink their teeth into.</li>
							<li>You&#8217;ll spend 10% of your time on your own projects that don&#8217;t need to relate to our business.</li>
							<li>Go sit with the CEO if you like; he works 15 metres from your desk.</li>
							<li>We have a tight relationship between devs and the people we do work for.</li>
							<li>We know good developers are valuable and in demand, so we pay very well.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Email us at devteamjobs@powershop.co.nz and tell us about what makes you excited about your work. Seriously, this is not just some feel-good marketing spiel: we really want to know. We’ll send you a position description and get you on track.</p>
