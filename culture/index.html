						<p>We&#8217;re looking for a stand-out graduate software engineer to join our Ruby on Rails development team. You&#8217;ll be smart, creative with good grades and a strong desire to join a lively - and sometimes lovely - team. You&#8217;ll have a passion for software and be keen to learn from the best.</p>

				<h3>Software Developer</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="grid-6">
						<p>Powershop might look like an electricity retailer, but it’s really a tech company in disguise: its entire operations are run by our in-house software. We’re looking for more passionate developers to join us, working on our codebase alongside our incredibly good team of devs.</p>
						<p>We use Ruby on Rails. Don’t know it yet? We’ll happily train you in Rails as part of your job. Ruby is a beautiful language; we guarantee you’ll love working with it.</p>
						<p>Here’s why you want to work here:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We’ve got a relaxed environment with music, pool table, table tennis, decent coffee, beer and fruit.</li>
							<li>We’re serious about agile; it’s not a buzzword. We do scrum, small integrated dev/design/test teams, peer code reviews and unit/integration tests because they all make for better software.</li>
							<li>Use whatever platform you like. Whatever editor you want. Do TDD? Great. Hate it? Fine. Peer programming? If you like. Work how you like working.</li>
							<li>The people here are seriously smart and open to new ideas. We don’t have any dead wood.</li>
							<li>It’s a stable job in a growing company that refuses to be enterprisey.</li>
							<li>There’s something for devs of all skill levels to sink their teeth into.</li>
							<li>You&#8217;ll spend 10% of your time on your own projects that don&#8217;t need to relate to our business.</li>
							<li>Go sit with the CEO if you like; he works 15 metres from your desk.</li>
							<li>We have a tight relationship between devs and the people we do work for.</li>
							<li>We know good developers are valuable and in demand, so we pay very well.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Email us at devteamjobs@powershop.co.nz and tell us about what makes you excited about your work. Seriously, this is not just some feel-good marketing spiel: we really want to know. We’ll send you a position description and get you on track.</p>

				<p>Nothing is sacred when you're transforming an industry. Powershop started with the idea that people could actually like their power company, a first in an industry where customers are known better by the numbers on their bill than their name.</p>

People with the chutzpah to believe that they can radically transform the electricity industry by making customers love their power company. Powershop&#8217;s employees are a bunch of mavericks and free-thinkers who like to question the accepted norms of our industry in search of a better way. It makes for a dynamic workplace - it&#8217;s fast paced, fun, results-focused and rewarding.</p>

Our New Zealand HQ is in Wellington, our country’s equivalent of Silicon Valley, except that it’s way smaller and has cheaper rent.</p>
