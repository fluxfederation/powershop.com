				<h3>Everyone’s on the <span class="nl">VIP list</span></h3>

				<h3>Smash your own <span class="nl">windows</span></h3>

				<p>Nothing is sacred when you're transforming an industry. Powershop started with the idea that people could actually like their power company, a first in an industry where customers are known better by the numbers on their bill than their name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-3 push-1">

				<h3>Pick on the <span class="nl">bullies</span></h3>

				<p>Industry goliaths across the globe are guilty of ignoring the interests of their customers and boring them into an apathetic, unengaged coma. A situation we're hell bent on rectifying. </p>

			<div class="grid-3 push-1">
				<h3>Have more <span class="nl">parties</span></h3>

				<p>Let’s face it. We sell the same electricity as everyone else but collaborating and colliding with each other, and our customers, is what makes us better and makes it fun.</p>

				<p>We want people who are passionate about what they do and who they do it for. Who believe that they can make a difference as an individual. People with the chutzpah to believe that they can radically transform the electricity industry by making customers love their power company. Powershop&#8217;s employees are a bunch of mavericks and free-thinkers who like to question the accepted norms of our industry in search of a better way. It makes for a dynamic workplace - it&#8217;s fast paced, fun, results-focused and rewarding.</p>

But underneath the smart casual exterior we're a driven lot with some of Australasia’s brightest minds in technology, business and design. Our New Zealand HQ is in Wellington, our country’s equivalent of Silicon Valley, except that it’s way smaller and has cheaper rent.</p>
