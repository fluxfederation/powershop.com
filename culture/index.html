		<h1 class="yell">Why we're a shit hot place to work</h1>

		<p class="larger">There is one thing all Powershop people have in common, and it’s the first thing we look for in future recruits — we all give a shit. </p>

		<p>We want people who are passionate about what they do and who they do it for. Who believe that they can make a difference as an individual. People with the chutzpah to believe that they can radically transform the electricity industry by making customers love their power company. Powershop’s employees are a bunch of mavericks and free-thinkers who like to question the accepted norms of our industry in search of a better way. It makes for a dynamic workplace - it’s fast paced, fun, results-focused and rewarding.</p>

			<p>Sure we've got the pool table, fancy coffee machine, beanbags and craft beer, and our CEO wears t-shirts (and pants, most days). But underneath the smart casual exterior we're a driven lot with some of Australasia’s brightest minds in technology, business and design. Our New Zealand HQ is in Wellington, our country’s equivalent of Silicon Valley, except that it’s way smaller and has cheaper rent.</p>
