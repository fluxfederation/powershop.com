				<p>We want people who are passionate about what they do and who they do it for. Who believe that they can make a difference as an individual. People with the chutzpah to believe that they can radically transform the electricity industry by making customers love their power company. Powershop&#8217;s employees are a bunch of mavericks and free-thinkers who like to question the accepted norms of our industry in search of a better way. It makes for a dynamic workplace - it&#8217;s fast paced, fun, results-focused and rewarding.</p>
