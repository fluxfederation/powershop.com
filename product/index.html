			<h3>We’ve made electricity a consumer good</h3>

			<p>To make an intangible thing like electricity more visible to customers and help them know exactly how much they’re using, we sell it as a product in a shop. Customers can buy it in bundles of units, grab a special, or let Powershop buy it for them.  They can get up-to-date information about their power usage and cost online, or from the emails we send. By breaking down consumption into a simple language of units, we’ve made it easy for people to control the amount of power they use, and given them a vocabulary to compare how they stack up against friends.</p>

					<p class="intro">Shopping for power helps people work out how much they need before they’re asked to pay for it. Rather than paying for power when the bill arrives, using an online shop gives customers flexibility and choice to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Get specials when they’re available.</li>
						<li>Pay for power when it suits them.</li>
						<li>Pre-purchase power for future use to smooth out costs throughout the year.</li>
						<li>Buy a combination of different Powerpacks – for example a special, some for the good of the environment and some for spring.</li>
