		<h2>The crusty utility industry has forever...</h2>

		<p>operated under a veil of confusion, preferring to keep customers at an arms reach that’s more like the distance from Antarctica to Amsterdam. Powershop started because it was clear there had to be a better way. </p>

		<p>The internet allows us to deliver an experience that’s fast, fun, simple and cost-effective. It’s a radical new way for people to buy and control their electricity. And let’s face it, a much better one. </p>

		<h2 class="yell">Design Thinking</h2>

		<h2>For god’s sake, look at us. We’re a power company and we’re pink. </h2>
		<p>We want to be the Frank Gehry of electricity retailing because we believe people prefer using things that are beautiful as well as functional. It’s not just about slapping on a coat of our trademark hot pink lipgloss, it’s about stitching design thinking into our underwear so customers enjoy every aspect of the Powershop experience.</p>
