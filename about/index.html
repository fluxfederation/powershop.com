		<h2>The crusty utility industry has forever...</h2>

		<p>operated under a veil of confusion, preferring to keep customers at an arms reach that’s more like the distance from Antarctica to Amsterdam. Powershop started because it was clear there had to be a better way. </p>

		<p>The internet allows us to deliver an experience that’s fast, fun, simple and cost-effective. It’s a radical new way for people to buy and control their electricity. And let’s face it, a much better one. </p>

			<h3>To make an intangible thing like electricity more visible to customers..</h3>

			<p>and help them know exactly how much they’re using, we sell it as a product in a shop. Customers can buy it in bundles of units, grab a special, or let Powershop buy it for them.  They can get up-to-date information about their power usage and cost online, or from the emails we send. By breaking down consumption into a simple language of units, we’ve made it easy for people to control the amount of power they use, and given them a vocabulary to compare how they stack up against friends.</p>

		<h3>For god’s sake, look at us. We’re a power company and we’re pink. </h3>

		<p>We want to be the Frank Gehry of electricity retailing because we believe people prefer using things that are beautiful as well as functional. It’s not just about slapping on a coat of our trademark hot pink lipgloss, it’s about stitching design thinking into our underwear so customers enjoy every aspect of the Powershop experience.</p>

It also means listening to what they have to say — like letting every customer choose what day of the month they pay for their power and how often they want to hear from us. </p>

		<h2 class="yell">Our History</h2>

		<h3>It hasn’t been a long road, but we’ve come a long way.</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="grid-9 columns">
				<p>Powershop launched in 2009 with a staff of three and in two years had became New Zealand’s fastest ever growing business*. We began with the notion that power could be sold like any other fast-moving consumer good, in different amounts with choice to match people’s various needs and preferences. We focused on the experience to make shopping for electricity easy and enjoyable, and provided the tools people need to understand how much power they use, giving them the control to lower bills.</p>

				<p>The ride hasn’t been without its wobbles. When we started, the first few months were slow. We expected people sign up in droves, begging to be released from the shackles of their existing retailer. In reality, we found traditional retailers had done a superb job of boring their customers into an apathetic, unengaged coma.   It was also a hassle to switch retailers — which is why we successfully lobbied to decrease the amount of time it took to change power companies.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, people talk. Our customers didn’t just tell their friends about Powershop, they raved to them. Powershop might be the newest kind of retailer but we’ve grown by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. Word has even spread to Australia, where we’ll be launching soon.</p>

								<p>If Simon moved in next door, you’d consider moving. He’s troublemaker by reputation who has a history of disrupting markets and shaking up traditional industries. Currently he’s possibly the only creative director on earth employed by a power company and responsible for the creation, design and continued development of Powershop’s brand, communications, and customer experience. Before Powershop, he spent 25 years working closely with organisations like Greenpeace International, The Economist, Universal Music and 42 Below vodka. Simon is also a founder of New Zealand’s only Fair-trade banana brand, All Good Organics, and has been known to wear a bright yellow gorilla suit all in the name of brand awareness. It’s high time he dressed up as a pink electron. </p>
