			<p>Our software allows us to deliver an experience that&#8217;s fast, fun, simple and cost-effective. It&#8217;s a radical new way for people to buy and control their electricity. And let&#8217;s face it, a much better one. </p>

		<h2 class="yell">Our History</h2>

		<h3>It hasn&#8217;t been a long road, but we&#8217;ve come a long way.</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="grid-9 columns">
				<p>Powershop was launched as a fully owned subsidiary of Meridian Energy Ltd in 2009 and in two years had become New Zealand's fastest ever growing business*. We began with the notion that power could be sold like any other fast-moving consumer good, in different amounts with choice to match people&#8217;s various needs and preferences. We focused on the experience to make shopping for electricity easy and enjoyable, and provided the tools people need to understand how much power they use, giving them the control to lower bills.</p>

				<p>The ride hasn&#8217;t been without its wobbles. When we started, the first few months were slow. We expected people to sign up in droves, begging to be released from the shackles of their existing retailer. In reality, we found traditional retailers had done a superb job of boring their customers into an apathetic, unengaged coma.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, people talk. Our customers didn&#8217;t just tell their friends about Powershop, they raved to them. Powershop might be the newest kind of retailer but we&#8217;ve grown by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. Word has even spread to Australia, where we launched in April 2012.</p>

							<h4>Ari Sargent</h4>
							<h5>Chief Executive<br /><small><a class="mail" href="mailto:ari.sargent@powershop.com">ari.sargent@powershop.com</a></small></h5>
							<p>Ari is the New Zealand electricity industry&#8217;s resident punk CEO. He might dress like a washed-up DJ, but he has spearheaded the radical transformation of electricity retailing in New Zealand. It&#8217;s no surprise, an engineer by training, Ari spent 20 years becoming a veteran square peg in power industry round holes until he had the long-overdue light bulb moment that lead to Powershop. He started cooking up Powershop in 2006, and three years later brought it to market. By 2011, he&#8217;d grown his idea into New Zealand&#8217;s fastest-ever growing company. He occasionally enjoys raising a finger to industry goliaths, but only when they&#8217;re being greedy or stupid. Luckily he&#8217;s more courteous to customers and regularly responds personally to their questions via social media. Just don&#8217;t tweet him while he&#8217;s watching his favourite TV show.</p>

							<h4>Umesh Parag</h4>
							<h5>Head of Finance</h5>
							<p>Powershop&#8217;s head of finance wears two hats. The first is pretty massive, with responsibility for maintaining the company&#8217;s enviable record of financial performance. The second is even larger and more unusual for a moneyman - his customer hat. He wears it to make sure every penny spent at Powershop will not adversely impact the fair prices Powershop customers pay for their power. Which is why you&#8217;re unlikely to see Powershop spending millions of dollars on expensive advertising or a flash waterfront office. Would be nice though, wouldn&#8217;t it Umesh?</p>

							<h4>Brian Bannister</h4>

							<p>Brian has been busy. He has rocked across most areas of IT, managing development, security and infrastructure for large companies and smaller startups. Like most successful rockers, he&#8217;s certainly gotten around, working for Telecom, Trustpower, ANZ, Xstrata Mines, Qantas, Sun, Hewlett Packard and British Telecom. Indulging his love of start-ups, Brian was drawn to Powershop by its youthful and disruptive appeal.  Years later and he&#8217;s still on the tour, managing IT strategy and day-to-day running of Powershop's IT staff, system development and server and desktop infrastructure.</p>

							<p>Beginning his career as a medical research scientist, Ed followed a commercial path and spent several years working for one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline, where he headed up its respiratory business. This was followed by a move into the media industry, working for realestate.com.au in roles across sales and marketing, operations, and pricing strategy</p>
							<p>In 2014, Ed made the decision to do something that would positively impact the future of his children’s lives and sought out an opportunity in the renewable energy space. This led to his leap to Powershop, ranked by Greenpeace as Australia’s greenest energy company (2014 &amp; 2015), where he joined as General Manager.</p>
