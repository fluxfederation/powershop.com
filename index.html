		<h1 class="yell">We are Powershop</h1>

		<p>Powershop is the world&#8217;s first online shop for electricity. Unlike traditional retailers, our software enables our customers to shop for power, get discounts and save money. They see how much they&#8217;re using and what it costs before they buy. It&#8217;s simple yet radical.</p>

				<h3>Smash your own <span class="nl">windows</span></h3>

				<p>Nothing is sacred when you're transforming an industry. Powershop started with the idea that people could actually like their power company, a first in an industry where customers are known better by the numbers on their bill than their name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-3 push-1">
				<h3>Be <span class="nl">beautiful</span></h3>

				<p>We give our customers a beautifully designed experience, transforming their power consumption data into tangible insights they can use to take action.</p>

				<h3>Pick on the <span class="nl">bullies</span></h3>

				<p>Industry goliaths across the globe are guilty of ignoring the interests of their customers and boring them into an apathetic, unengaged coma. A situation we're hell bent on rectifying. </p>

			<div class="grid-3 push-1">
				<h3>Everyone’s on the <span class="nl">VIP list</span></h3>

			<div class="grid-3 push-1">
				<h3>Have more <span class="nl">parties</span></h3>
