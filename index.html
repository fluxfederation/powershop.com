		<h2 class="yell">Our History</h2>

		<h3>It hasn&#8217;t been a long road, but we&#8217;ve come a long way.</h3>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="grid-9 columns">
				<p>Powershop was launched as a fully owned subsidiary of Meridian Energy Ltd in 2009 and in two years had become New Zealand's fastest ever growing business*. We began with the notion that power could be sold like any other fast-moving consumer good, in different amounts with choice to match people&#8217;s various needs and preferences. We focused on the experience to make shopping for electricity easy and enjoyable, and provided the tools people need to understand how much power they use, giving them the control to lower bills.</p>

				<p>The ride hasn&#8217;t been without its wobbles. When we started, the first few months were slow. We expected people to sign up in droves, begging to be released from the shackles of their existing retailer. In reality, we found traditional retailers had done a superb job of boring their customers into an apathetic, unengaged coma.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, people talk. Our customers didn&#8217;t just tell their friends about Powershop, they raved to them. Powershop might be the newest kind of retailer but we&#8217;ve grown by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. Word has even spread to Australia, where we launched in April 2012.</p>

							<h4>Ari Sargent</h4>
							<h5>Chief Executive<br /><small><a class="mail" href="mailto:ari.sargent@powershop.com">ari.sargent@powershop.com</a></small></h5>
					
							<p>Ari is the New Zealand electricity industry&#8217;s resident punk CEO. He might dress like a washed-up DJ, but he has spearheaded the radical transformation of electricity retailing in New Zealand. It&#8217;s no surprise, an engineer by training, Ari spent 20 years becoming a veteran square peg in power industry round holes until he had the long-overdue light bulb moment that lead to Powershop. He started cooking up Powershop in 2006, and three years later brought it to market. By 2011, he&#8217;d grown his idea into New Zealand&#8217;s fastest-ever growing company. He occasionally enjoys raising a finger to industry goliaths, but only when they&#8217;re being greedy or stupid. Luckily he&#8217;s more courteous to customers and regularly responds personally to their questions via social media. Just don&#8217;t tweet him while he&#8217;s watching his favourite TV show.</p>

							<h4>Jim Barrett</h4>
							<h5>Head of Operations</h5>
							

							<p>Brainy Jim has a PhD in Engineering and has served a 14-year stretch in the electricity industry. He&#8217;s Powershop&#8217;s business brain and our people person, which is good because he has oversight of our software development, operations and customer service. This means he&#8217;s responsible for maintaining our record-breaking customer service rankings and the smooth running of our website. As well as being very good at multi-tasking and maintaining high standards, Jim&#8217;s big brain has lead the development of Powershop&#8217;s crowning glory, a web application that exceeds all regulatory and technical requirements while remaining easy and enjoyable to use.</p>

					<div id="fixer" class="person_detail">
						<div class="people_content">
							<h4>Monique Greene</h4>
							<h5>General Counsel</h5>
							
							<p>Monique has infinite patience, which is fortunate, because Powershop is a company that likes to push boundaries and sometimes buttons. Monique has the rare quality of being able to assess risk while still considering brand, and she talks like a normal person and not in some strange language that only lawyers understand. As Powershop&#8217;s General Counsel, Monique&#8217;s accountabilities are wide-ranging and include Legal, Regulatory, Governance, HR and Stakeholder Relations. Monique is trusted with the final word on decisions of the highest level and is well regarded for her keen sense of risk, and formidable knowledge of the legal and regulatory issues in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity industry.</p>

							<h4>Hamish Wilkie</h4>
							<h5>Head of Sales and Marketing</h5>

							<p>Hamish can make numbers do things that they won&#8217;t do for other people. Actually, it&#8217;s a bit weird. He&#8217;s done pioneering work with some of New Zealand&#8217;s leading brands, by utilising his rare talent of being able to look at a spreadsheet and see people, not just numbers. When the rest of the power industry was churning out the same old irrelevant products, Hamish used his powers of visualisation to develop products, specials and power packs based firmly on customer needs, a first among electricity retailers. He has identified and prioritised key opportunities, built capability to achieve them, and attracted new customer segments - helping Powershop lift its commercial performance to award-winning levels.</p>

							<h4>Umesh Parag</h4>
							<h5>Head of Finance</h5>

							<p>Powershop&#8217;s head of finance wears two hats. The first is pretty massive, with responsibility for maintaining the company&#8217;s enviable record of financial performance. The second is even larger and more unusual for a moneyman - his customer hat. He wears it to make sure every penny spent at Powershop will not adversely impact the fair prices Powershop customers pay for their power. Which is why you&#8217;re unlikely to see Powershop spending millions of dollars on expensive advertising or a flash waterfront office. Would be nice though, wouldn&#8217;t it Umesh?</p>

							<h4>Zef Fugaz</h4>
							<h5>Head of Design</h5>
					
							<p>After a chilly childhood living in shacks lit by kerosene lamps in outback New Zealand, Zef loves the power of electricity. He thinks it’s a little bit magic. These days he’s up to his neck in technology but with a focus firmly on the customer driving it.</p>

							<p>He’s possibly the only designer on Earth on the executive of a power company – responsible for the creation, design and continued development of Powershop’s mighty customer experience. His team at Powershop are tasked with taming the feral pink electrons before setting them loose on our customers and tickling their appetite for positive power.</p>

							<h4>Alex Macmillan</h4>
							<h5>Revenue and Pricing Manager</h5>

							<p>Alex was probably doing the Rubik&#8217;s Cube at kindy. Now that he has a Masters Degree in Finance and over seven years experience in the electricity industry in both the retail and wholesale environments, he has become one of New Zealand&#8217;s few experts at navigating the economic and political minefield of electricity pricing. As Revenue and Pricing Manager, Alex is responsible for maximising overall revenue through effective cost recovery and pricing. He&#8217;s a master of balance and delicately manages price setting and margin to keep both customers and the men upstairs happy.</p>

							<h4>Brian Bannister</h4>
							<h5>Chief Technology Officer</h5>

							<p>Brian has been busy. He has rocked across most areas of IT, managing development, security and infrastructure for large companies and smaller startups. Like most successful rockers, he&#8217;s certainly gotten around, working for Telecom, Trustpower, ANZ, Xstrata Mines, Qantas, Sun, Hewlett Packard and British Telecom. Indulging his love of start-ups, Brian was drawn to Powershop by its youthful and disruptive appeal.  Years later and he&#8217;s still on the tour, managing IT strategy and day-to-day running of Powershop's IT staff, system development and server and desktop infrastructure.</p>
